# Purple Martin Conservation

This is an app designed for the Purple Martin Conservation Association and its memembers, indending to improve their user experience and foster public's understanding on Purple Martin

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the app, we currently only support through the simulator. But we will gradually incorporate more deployment options, including Apple App Store and Google Play Store.


### Installing

- Running on your linux machine

1. In your command window, enter the following command

```
git clone git@github.com:ndmobilecomplab/purple-martin.git
```

And wait for the repository to be cloned to your current directory. Then, we need to set up the ionic cordova environment in order to run the app. 

Enter the newly downloaded directory, enter the following code:

```
ionic cordova prepare
```

Then the environment should be successfully set up!

## Running the tests

Now, you can run the app on your computer, simply enter the following code in the current directory:

```
ionic serve -l
```

It will open a window in your browser with simulators
